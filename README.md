This is my minesweeper AI project.

The game is a fully functional minesweeper clone but with added self solving algorithms.

It currently only uses algorithms to determine safe tiles but I have plans to expand it to a neural network in the future.

Pressing Tab starts up and stops the AI and pressing R resets the map.

It uses the mouse pointer but it does not leave the screen or click anywhere except the game window so do not be alarmed.
